I'd a pluck a fair rose for my love
I'd a pluck a red rose blowin
Love's in my heart, I'm tryin so to prove
What you heart's knowin
I'd a pluck a finger on a thorn
I'd a pluck a finger bleedin
Red is my heart wounded and forlorn
And your heart needin
I'd a hold a finger to my tongue
I'd a hold a finger waitin
My heart is sore until it joins in song
With your heart matin
My heart is sore until it joins in song
With your heart matin
